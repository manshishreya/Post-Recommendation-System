The Address Books Project will be a personal platform where you can keep track of the contact details such as phone number, email-ID, address, etc. of your friends, family, colleagues, and others. You can start to build this particular project considering these basic features – adding a new contact, saving it, and search &amp; view contacts. Several additional features that can also be considered are – editing an existing contact, deleting a contact, etc. Though the entire programming for the project can be done using fundamental HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, you can also use an API that generates placeholder data and can structure the JSON as per your skill level. You need to know that an Address Book Project can be created from the basic to the advanced level, so try to build it from the basic level first.</th>\n",

       "      <th>💤 How can you go to bed every night, not knowing how you will feel in the morning? This is my question to those who’re not using a smart sleep alarm. Smart alarms are the Holy Grail of health tracking. In short: There might be only 2 minutes (light vs deep sleep) between the two states after the wake-up. Would you opt for needing 3 cups of coffee to start the day or being able to start the day with energy? A smart alarm helps you wake up only from light sleep to feel better the entire day. Jackpot! Give me a reason why you’d not want this in your life!

Try The Feeling Alphabet Activity Set, co-authored with Dr. Ed Wang of Harvard Medical School.  It has activities, games, strategies and approaches for naming feelings; unless you can name them (the positive and negative ones), you cannot tame them.  $4.99 for download at  https://lnkd.in/eQRjuET .  Bulk download pricing available for use with groups. Key here is this works: and there is an introduction we co-authored that is worth reading -- in any case -- whether you use the activities or not.  It explains how our feelings, thoughts and behaviors work together.  The important brain triangle. \n",

      "5: Assuming Dr. Ford testifies, I want to know how we can get people on the Judiciary Committee and in the Senate truly to listen. Could we put our R/D affiliation in a drawer and just listen and hear?  If the point of a hearing is to hear, then prejudging and announcing one's vote ahead of time or that Judge Kavanaugh will be appointed misses the point of a hearing. And why plow ahead?  We plow fields not people. I get the rush but do we do justice by rushing to find truth? One more thought:  Youthful indiscretion is not rare. What is bad here is: failure to own one's past; failure to apologize; lying. The Justices decide about real people; truth matters.  Truly matters.  So does integrity.  So does honesty.  Judge Kavanaugh is not being criminally charged (too late); but he bears burden of persuasion.  This isn't about innocent until proven guilty in a criminal trial. There is no trial. There is a hearing on fitness and integrity. Worth distinguishing and remembering. \n",
